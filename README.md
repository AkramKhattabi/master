Introduction:

Optical Character Recognition OCR technology plays a crucial role in
converting handwritten or printed text from physical documents into digital
format, enabling computers to process and analyze the text data.OCR systems
are designed to interpret the shapes, patterns ,and structures of characters within
an image and convert them into machine-readable text that can be further
processed , edited , or stored electronically While OCR technology initially gained
prominence for its ability to recognize printed text, advancement in machine
learning and computer vision have expanded its capabilities to include
handwritten text recognition .

Overall, OCR technology serves as a fundamental tool for automating data
entry, document processing, and information retrieval tasks, offering significant
benefits in terms of efficiency and cost-effectiveness. As research and
development in OCR continue to advance, the capabilities of OCR systems for
handwritten text recognition are expected to improve further, driving greater
adoption and integration across various industries and applications.
